# Analyzing-Cardiovascular-Health-Outcomes-Across-American-Communities-Using-X

Abstract
Objectives: Periodic public health surveillance of cardiovascular health (CVH) is important for understanding the health of communities. This study examines the feasibility and associations of assessing modifiable cardiovascular health (CVH) behaviors, including Life’s Essential 8™ (LE8) factors (e.g., healthy sleep), using population-level X data across U.S. communities.

Setting and Design: We computationally analyzed 32 million tweets with CVH-related keywords from March 2017 to 2022 to understand (a) the relation between the frequency of tweets discussing CVH behaviors and reported CVH outcomes from surveys from the PLACES dataset, (b) common themes of tweets across U.S. communities (based on the American Communities Project (ACP), topology), and (c) utility of tweets corresponding to CVH outcomes.
 
Primary and Secondary Outcome measures: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics associated with U.S. communities. 

Results: The frequency of tweets and prevalence of LE8 factors measured by self-reported surveys were correlated with Get Healthy Sleep (r = 0.5751 (p<0.05) and Be More Active/Manage Weight (r = -0.6022 (p<0.03). Statistically significant LDA topics (p<0.05) were identified for six out of the fourteen ACP communities, primarily related to smoking and alcohol. Machine learning models trained using Twitter language can reliably predict CVH measures, corresponding to Be More Active/Manage Weight, Quit Tobacco, and Get Healthy Sleep outcomes at the county- level (r ≳ 0.6, p<0.05). ACP-specific two-proportion z-tests highlight significant differences in the distribution of CVH-related tweets across communities (p<0.05).

Conclusions: Population-level social media data like X can provide a feasible and informative supplement for monitoring modifiable CVH  across U.S. communities. Tweet content and frequency were meaningfully associated with survey-based CVH measures and machine learning models reliably predicted key LE8 outcomes such as physical activity, weight management, tobacco cessation, and healthy sleep.
